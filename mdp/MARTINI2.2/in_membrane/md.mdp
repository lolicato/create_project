; STANDARD MD INPUT OPTIONS FOR MARTINI 2.x
; Updated 15 Jul 2015 by DdJ
;
; for use with GROMACS 5
; For a thorough comparison of different mdp options in combination with the Martini force field, see:
; D.H. de Jong et al., Martini straight: boosting performance using a shorter cutoff and GPUs, submitted.

; TIMESTEP IN MARTINI
; Most simulations are numerically stable with dt=40 fs,
; however better energy conservation is achieved using a
; 20-30 fs timestep.
; Time steps smaller than 20 fs are not required unless specifically stated in the itp file.

; NEIGHBOURLIST and MARTINI
; To achieve faster simulations in combination with the Verlet-neighborlist
; scheme, Martini can be simulated with a straight cutoff. In order to
; do so, the cutoff distance is reduced 1.1 nm.
; Neighborlist length should be optimized depending on your hardware setup:
; updating ever 20 steps should be fine for classic systems, while updating
; every 30-40 steps might be better for GPU based systems.
;
; Improper neighbor list settings result in artifical pressure oscillations and
; violation of spatial isotropy.
; To avoid this, the verlet-buffer-tolerance is explicitly disabled.
; rlist should be at least 1.35 nm (with nstlist = 20 and rcoulomb/rvdw = 1.1).
; To use nstlist > 20, rlist must be further increased and tested.
; This helps to reduce the artificially large undulation amplitude of Martini membranes.
; (Position restraints might not be necessary -- to be confirmed)
; To further minimize the artifact, nstt/pcouple = n * nstlist, n is positive integer.
;
; Coulomb interactions can alternatively be treated using a reaction-field,
; giving slightly better properties.
; Please realize that electrostVatic interactions in the Martini model are
; not considered to be very accurate to begin with, especially as the
; screening in the system is set to be uniform across the system with
; a screening constant of 15. When using PME, please make sure your
; system properties are still reasonable.
;
; With the polarizable water model, the relative electrostatic screening
; (epsilon_r) should have a value of 2.5, representative of a low-dielectric
; apolar solvent. The polarizable water itself will perform the explicit screening
; in aqueous environment. In this case, the use of PME is more realistic.

; MARTINI and TEMPERATURE/PRESSURE
; normal temperature and pressure coupling schemes can be used.
; It is recommended to couple individual groups in your system separately.
; Good temperature control can be achieved with the velocity rescale (V-rescale)
; thermostat using a coupling constant of the order of 1 ps. Even better
; temperature control can be achieved by reducing the temperature coupling
; constant to 0.1 ps, although with such tight coupling (approaching
; the time step) one can no longer speak of a weak-coupling scheme.
; We therefore recommend a coupling time constant of at least 0.5 ps.
; The Berendsen thermostat is less suited since it does not give
; a well described thermodynamic ensemble.
;
; Pressure can be controlled with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat,
; with a coupling constant in the range 4-8 ps and typical compressibility
; in the order of 10e-4 - 10e-5 bar-1. Note that, for equilibration purposes,
; the Berendsen barostat probably gives better results, as the Parrinello-
; Rahman is prone to oscillating behaviour. For bilayer systems the pressure
; coupling should be done semiisotropic.

; The recommended barostat is the stochastic cell rescaling barostat (c-rescale) 
; due to its exponential relaxation property. Martini lipids are benchmarked 
; with a coupling constant of 4 ps and compressibility 3e-4.
; C-rescale can be used for both equilibration and production simulations 
; (https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0020514). 
; For bilayer systems, the pressure should maintained using semiisotropic coupling.
; As of GROMACS 2023, c-rescale is not implemented for full anisotropic systems, 
; but will likely be implemented (https://gitlab.com/gromacs/gromacs/-/merge_requests/3720).
; For now, full anisotropic coupling can be done using Berendsen barostat, even though 
; the sampled ensemble is theoretically not NPT. The PR barostat is not recommended for 
; crystal-like systems where crystal breaking (box elongation resulting in breaking) 
; has been observed due to pressure oscillations.
